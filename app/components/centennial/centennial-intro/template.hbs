    <h2>WNYC’S Centennial Celebration</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="centennial-intro__text">
    <p>WNYC launched onto the airwaves on July 8, 1924, with a bold mandate: to serve, in the words of our visionary founder Grover Whalen, as “the voice of New York.” Today, that first broadcast echoes as a credo, a challenge, and a resounding call to action.</p>
    <p>As WNYC’s Centennial approaches, we're excited to celebrate our first – and next – 100 years with you.</p>
    <p>First up: on July 8, join us for an on-air birthday celebration! Kicking off at 7 p.m., Brian Lehrer will be joined by WNYC Archivist Andy Lanset and special friends. Then, we’ll present a reimagining of WNYC’s debut broadcast from 1924, with Arturo O’Farrill providing musical accompaniment.</p>
    <p>That's just the beginning! Stay tuned here for Centennial programming updates, and to learn more about how you can get involved, email <a href="mailto:giving@nypublicradio.org">giving@nypublicradio.org</a>.</p>
